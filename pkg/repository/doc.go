// Package repository provides interfaces for data persistence operations in the hexagonal architecture.
// It defines the contracts for storage operations that the application's domain logic depends on.
// These interfaces act as ports that allow the core business logic to remain isolated from specific
// storage implementation details, following the dependency inversion principle.
